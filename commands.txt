aws eks update-kubeconfig --name almogo --region eu-central-1
kubectl config get-contexts
it will show the list of clusters, but in order to have permissions to access kubectl resources, you need to edit the aws-auth configmap
if its an instance' you neeed to update the mapRoles:
    - groups:
      - system:masters
      rolearn: arn:aws:iam::055618680309:role/ec2-role
      username: ec2-role
if its a user you need to update the mapUser
kubectl edit cm aws-auth -n kube-system
